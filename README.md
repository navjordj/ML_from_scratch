Machine learning library with algorithms implemented only using Numpy.
Follows the scikit-learn API as close as possible.

Algorithms are implemented from the following courses:
* [DAT200](https://www.nmbu.no/course/dat200)
* [Andrew NG machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* [Deeplearning.ai deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
